1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions without explicit programming. Instead of writing specific instructions, we provide data, and the machine finds patterns to make decisions.

Example:

Traditional Programming: You write rules to classify emails as spam or not.
Machine Learning: You provide a dataset of spam and non-spam emails, and the model learns the patterns automatically.
2️⃣ Types of Machine Learning
✅ Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data (input-output pairs).

Example: Predicting house prices based on size and location.
✅ Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns in data without labels.

Example: Grouping customers based on shopping behavior.
✅ Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties.

Example: AI playing chess and improving over time.
3️⃣ Real-World Applications of ML
🚗 Self-driving cars – Detecting objects and making driving decisions.
📧 Spam filters – Automatically sorting spam emails.
🎥 Netflix recommendations – Suggesting movies based on watch history.
💰 Stock market prediction – Predicting price trends using past data.

4️⃣ How Does a Machine Learn?
1️⃣ Collect Data – Gather data from various sources.
2️⃣ Prepare Data – Clean and preprocess the data.
3️⃣ Train a Model – Use algorithms to learn patterns.
4️⃣ Test the Model – Check its accuracy on new data.
5️⃣ Deploy the Model – Use it in real-world applications.
